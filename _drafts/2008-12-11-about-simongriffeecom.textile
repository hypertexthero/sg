This is my personal website â€” a place for me to publish my photographs and other projects in electronic form[1]. The main sections of the site are described below.

My sketches, usually photographs, occasionally words and drawings, are in the <a href="/notebook/">Notebook</a> section. A new picture appears often, almost every day. You can explore past sketches in the notebook archive by <a href="/notebookthumbnails/">thumbnails</a>, <a href="/notebooktimeline/">timeline</a> and <a href="/notebooktitle/">title</a>. 

My photographic essays and long and short-term projects can be found in the <a href="/stories/">Stories</a> section. You can view stories organized by <a href="/stories/">latest update</a>, <a href="/storiestitle/">title</a> and <a href="/storiestimeline/">timeline</a>.

The sheer amount of screens today can make it difficult to remember (or discover) that photographs are beautiful _physical objects_, too. Archival carbon ink prints of a selection of my photographs are <a href="/prints/">available for sale</a>.

<txp:hide>I have a virtual shop window for my black and white prints over at "Dear Moment (Only seven of each print available!)":http://dearmoment.com and also started the shamelessly extravagant "Generous Alphabet Project (Buy a letter or refer a millionaire!)":http://generousalphabet.org with "Amber":http://descriptedlines.com.

You can set the background of this website to <a id="defaultstyle" href="serversideSwitch.html?style=default" rel="default" class="styleswitch">lamp black</a>, <a id="darkstyle" href="serversideSwitch.html?style=dark" rel="dark" class="styleswitch">dark</a> and <a id="lightstyle" href="serversideSwitch.html?style=light" rel="light" class="styleswitch">light</a>. You can also click on the 'lights' link on the top-right to turn off the lights for a better photograph viewing experience. </txp:hide>
