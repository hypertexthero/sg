SimonGriffee.com is now a static site using the open source [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Known as a static site generator, Jekyll generates the files for the site on my personal computer. I then transfer them to the server.") publishing software. To you, dear visitor, the main gain is the site is faster. To me, it is more secure, simpler and more lasting (HTML and plain text are the analogue film of the software world).

The [script](https://gist.github.com/hypertexthero/9a9d51aeef78742ccfc1) I used to pull the content from my previous software[^1] is a modified version of [this one](http://gath.co.nz/bhalg/migrating-from-textpattern-to-octopress/). On my computer this was at `/Users/Simon/.rbenv/versions/1.9.2-p290/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/jekyll-import-0.1.0/lib/jekyll-import/importers`.
