h2(#collectionmes). Mês Collection Prints

Every month a photograph is added to the <em>Mês Collection</em> of prints available in a limited edition of selected sizes. Prices of Mês Collection Prints increase over time and so does the value of your investment. The type, size and price of each edition's prints vary and detailed information about each month's edition can be found on the edition's page. Each limited edition includes five artist's copies of each size. An "archive of previous editions is available":/printsmes/.


h2. Sizes, Packaging, Prices

The exact size of the printed image varies and the print size refers to the paper size. Each print has the title, date, my signature, and if part of a limited edition, the edition number written in pencil on the back. Prints are not framed and are currently only available unmatted.

h2(#printqualities). Print Qualities

The black and white prints are have a great range of tonalities from deep blacks to distinct greys and clear, smooth whites, and the matte paper used gives a very slight warmth to the images. The prints use pure "carbon black pigment ink (Carbon Ink Prints information.)":http://www.cjcom.net/articles/carbonink.htm only and are coated with Hahnemühle protective spray. The combination of printing system, ink, paper and coating gives the prints "a very long life without fading (Paul Roark's Digital B&W Printing Information Index.)":http://www.paulroark.com/BW-Info/, close to or surpassing silver prints. Copyright watermarks are _not_ present on prints.

All prints are printed with an R800 printer controlled by custom "Quad Tone Rip software":http://www.quadtonerip.com/html/QTRoverview.html using the <acronym title="3 Matte Black">3MK</acronym> system of "100% pure carbon archival black ink (100% Carbon Pigment Digital Black and White : Paul Roark.)":http://www.paulroark.com/BW-Info/R1800.htm from "MIS Associates (MIS Black and White Ink Products page.)":http://www.inksupply.com/bwpage.cfm. The paper used is usually *Hahnemühle Photo Rag 308g/m<sup>2</sup>* fiber-based matte paper of museum archival quality. I may use different types of paper (always acid free, of archival quality) for particular limited editions, and the type of paper used will always be listed on each edition's page. There is generous white space around the images for proper matting.

h2(#thankyou). Thank You

I consider fine prints the ultimate expression of the photographic process. A beautiful photographic print is an object which can take you on our own journeys and a companion who you can live with all your life. When you buy a fine print here or at "DearMoment.com":http://dearmoment.com you directly help me continue to photograph. Thank you!
