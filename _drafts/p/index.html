<h3 id="prices">Sizes, Packaging, Prices</h3>

<p>The exact size of the printed image varies and the print size refers to the paper size. Each print has the title, date, my signature, and if part of a limited edition, the edition number written in pencil on the back. Prints are <strong>not</strong> matted or framed.</p>

<h3 id="delivery">Shipping, Delivery Time</h3>

<p>All prints are shipped insured, flat and sturdily packed. Shipping of the prints to anywhere in the world is included in the price. Please allow up to <i>one month</i> from ordering to delivery as a general rule.</p>

<h3>Satisfaction Guarantee</h3>

<p>I understand that it is a risk to purchase a fine print over the internet without seeing it in person first. If you are not happy with your purchase, send the print back to me in original packaging and condition within 30 days of my shipment to you and I will refund you your money (minus the shipping cost). It won’t do you or I any good if you are not 100% satisfied with your print.</p>
