<h1><a href="message-from-mambo-king.html" title="Permanent link to Message From Mambo King">Message From Mambo King</a></h1>

	<p>This in the Jimmy <span class="caps">BOSS</span> mail <span class="caps">BOX</span> this morning:</p>

	<p><em>Jimmy Boss, I&#8217;ve been trying to ignore you for some time but in your messages I understand you are so hungry for recogintion, that I feel tread upon. I can&#8217;t ignore the fact that you are after my followers. For your information, me, the Mambo King (the only). I&#8217;ve been on the pedestal for many, many years now and I&#8217;m not gonna let any Jimmy Boss take it from me. After many hours of thoughts there is only one solution, there is no room for two in this world. So, I don&#8217;t have any other choice but to challenge you to a dual.</em></p>

	<p><em>You choose the battlefield, I would recommed it in this solar system because I don&#8217;t like to travel too far. The weapons will be your rambo knife against my maracas. The judges will be Franco, Mussellini and Celia Cruis. In case one of these persons can not assist, we will call compadre Segundo from Cubanismo. So, don&#8217;t hesitate in this challenge, I want to fit you in my busy schedule. I would never want to go to this point but you are irritating me so much that my mambo became a tango. Get ready for the final dance Jimmy!</em></p>

	<p><img src="images/mambo-king.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="533" /></p>

	<p class="caption">The photograph which accompanied the message above.</p>

	<p><strong>Jimmy replies:</strong></p>

	<p>Mr. Mambo, thanks for your message. I understand that it&#8217;s damn cold where you are right now and you miss the sun, but please, relax. Maybe go to the mall and get some new clothes, maybe a new coat. Lets talk this over a couple margaritas—I&#8217;m sure we can come to an understanding without any <span class="caps">BLOODSHED</span>. Jimmy is not a man of violence, though he packs heat when strictly necessary. Remember the scene in Indiana Jones where Indy shoots the guy with the crazy swords? Indy&#8217;s style was based on Jimmy.</p>

	<p>The hat is nice. We should start that hat business together soon, when we overcome any misunderstandings. Say hi to Crowbar for me and make sure the women keep the margaritas and tapas coming from the kitchen. Need to keep warm. See you pronto!</p>

	<p>Jimmy Boss</p>

	<p><a href="jez.html">Jez</a>, Jimmy hasn&#8217;t heard from you in a while and now he sees <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7794868.stm" title="Repairs begin on undersea cable.">this</a> on the fucking news and he thinks &#8220;Hey, what the fuck is this? Why hasn&#8217;t Jez got in touch regarding comms operations off the Maltese coast?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Smells funny to Jimmy. Like when they collect the garbage in 4th Street on Thursdays and don&#8217;t do a good job cleaning the fucking sidewalk afterwards. <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.12/ffglass_pr.html" title="Wired article about laying of sea comms cables.">Comms channels</a> ruptured and a fucking French <em>robot called Hector</em> going in to fix them? What the fuck is this? Why isn&#8217;t The Organization in control of this operation, huh? </p>

	<p>In other news, Nicky sent me an email a while ago—he&#8217;s in some bank operation in London or something. I&#8217;m pretty sure I replied like Jimmy always does, but then I didn&#8217;t hear back again. Going to have to find the Man From Malay and get him to get in touch with the family again. People <span class="caps">THINKING</span> <span class="caps">ONLY</span> <span class="caps">BUSINESS</span> and <span class="caps">FORGETTING</span> <span class="caps">ABOUT</span> <span class="caps">FAMILY</span> worry Jimmy.</p>

	<p>Oh yeah, Merry Fucking Christmas to everybody! Have some nice porchetta for me, and if you&#8217;re a fucking vegetarian, or, god help you, a fucking vegan, then at least have some <span class="caps">FUCKING</span> <span class="caps">NICE</span> <span class="caps">FAKE</span> <span class="caps">CHOCOLATE</span> <span class="caps">CAKE</span> in the DE-HY-<span class="caps">DRATOR</span> for me!! Just don&#8217;t forget to cook it while you&#8217;re waiting for your pizza that you put in the oven yesterday. </p>

	<p>Couple more things: </p>

	<ul>
		<li>Forget about the gas and oil prices, the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7798696.stm" title="Cocoa prices soar.">real emergency</a> is upon us.</li>
		<li>Still stumped about the Xmas present and don&#8217;t mind being a few days late? Go get one of <a href="http://x-entertainment.com/updates/2008/03/21/rambo-made-me-love-jade/" title="Rambo survival kit.">these</a> on Ebay.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Merry Jimmy out!!</p>

		<p>Hey. Getting these details right is important. Gettin&#8217; them wrong can get <span class="caps">PEOPLE</span> <span class="caps">SHOT</span>.</p>
		<p>Like Joey, the time we did the hit on the Mancinos&#8217; lavanderia over at 5th and Ocean. Sanchez had said the two cars were gonna show in front of the fucking place at a precise fucking time. Joey, smartass that he always wanted to be, insisted that he had heard Sanchez say &#8216;<span class="caps">ZULU</span>-time&#8217; when Sanchez really mean&#8217;t the <span class="caps">FUCKING</span> <span class="caps">TIME</span> <span class="caps">ZONA</span> <span class="caps">THEY</span> <span class="caps">WERE</span> <span class="caps">ALL</span> IN <span class="caps">ALREADY</span>.</p>
		<p>So Joey shows up early together with Vincennes and most importantly, with the Mancinos boys still outside, and gets two-hundred rounds of .30 in his <span class="caps">FUCKING</span> <span class="caps">CHEST</span>, while poor Vincennes can&#8217;t even be <span class="caps">FUCKING</span> <span class="caps">FOUND</span> anymore after being hit <span class="caps">FULL</span>-ON with one of those Russian <span class="caps">RPG</span> jobs.</p>
		<p>By the time we arrived the Mancinos and the money was gone.</p>
		<p>Sanchez wasn&#8217;t happy. Charlie wasn&#8217;t happy. Frankie wasn&#8217;t happy. And Jimmy was <span class="caps">VERY</span> unhappy. Very <span class="caps">FUCKING</span> disappointed in fact. </p>
		<p>So get your <span class="caps">FUCKING</span> <span class="caps">TIME</span> <span class="caps">STRAIGHT</span> Vinnie, or innocent people might get shot this time. See you at 21:00, <span class="caps">ROME</span> <span class="caps">FUCKING</span> <span class="caps">TIME</span>, in front of <span class="caps">WARNER</span> <span class="caps">VILAAAAAAACH</span> <span class="caps">REPUBLICANA</span> <span class="caps">CINEMO</span>!!!!</p>
