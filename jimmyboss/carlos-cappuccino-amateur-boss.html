<h1><a href="carlos-cappuccino-amateur-boss.html" title="Permanent link to Carlos &#34;Cappuccino&#34; Amateur Boss">Carlos &#34;Cappuccino&#34; Amateur Boss</a></h1>

	<p>Jimmy was tired. </p>

	<p>Too much <span class="caps">HORSE</span> <span class="caps">SHIT</span> from <span class="caps">FUCKING</span> <span class="caps">SUITS</span> he had to deal with at work in his head. Not enough energy to do much else than play videogames when he got home. Not enough sleep.</p>

	<p>He needed a fucking coffee.</p>

	<p>The bar on the way to work was one of the few things that helped convince him to get up in the morning. Carlos worked there.</p>

	<p>Carlos made the best damn cappuccino in Rome, and Jimmy had many of them during his year working undercover in the corporate telecoms office. The cappuccinos and cornettos were just enough to keep Jimmy&#8217;s <span class="caps">ROAD</span> <span class="caps">RAGE</span> from getting out of control and spilling out onto the streets along with the blood and guts of those unfortunate enough to be in Jimmy&#8217;s vicinity. Jimmy played Grand Theft Auto at night, and it took a lot of <span class="caps">CALM</span>-<span class="caps">COOLNESS</span> not to <span class="caps">CAREEN</span> into other <span class="caps">AUTO</span>-<span class="caps">MOBILES</span> on his way to work. Every fucking morning.</p>

	<p>Then Jimmy quit and went traveling and photographing and Being Boss. He became much <span class="caps">HAPPIER</span> not being in a fucking vehicle for three hours a day. He felt more <span class="caps">PLEASANT</span> by not having to do shit he knew was shit in order to satisfy somebody else&#8217;s insecurity about their life and position in their grey scheme. When he didn&#8217;t have to answer to anybody else other than himself, Jimmy felt <span class="caps">CALMER</span>. </p>

	<p>Jimmy knows a shrink who says that the modern life of traffic and commuting and office work makes humans go fucking crazy and that stress makes them get sick more often. Jimmy thinks he&#8217;s right.</p>

 <a href="images/carlos-cappuccino-L.jpg" title="Carlos in the bar." rel="lightbox"><img src="images/7.jpg" width="500" height="336" alt="A picture of Carlos working with the coffee machine in the bar." /></a>

	<p class="caption">Carlos in the bar.</p>

	<p>The other day Jimmy met Carlos again and was happy to hear that he&#8217;s Becoming Boss. He told Jimmy that he started over <span class="caps">FRESH</span> after some bad times. Started <span class="caps">ANEW</span>, without fear, this year.</p>

	<p>He got himself a camera and is photographing and studying photography againâ€”his old passion. Jimmy&#8217;s sure he&#8217;ll be photographing full-time in no time because he says it&#8217;s what he loves to do. </p>

	<p>Today the word &#8220;amateur&#8221; has a negative meaning. Even the dictionary on Jimmy&#8217;s computer says so. And this is fucking wrong. To Jimmy, being an amateur means <em>loving what you do</em> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur">&#8216;<em>reflecting a voluntary motivation to work as a result of personal passion for a particular activity</em>&#8216;</a>. Fuck experts, fuck professionals<sup class="footnote"><a href="carlos-cappuccino-amateur-boss.html#fn8243642948a09527ea64e">1</a></sup> and fuck the dictionary. Amateurs such as Carlos are the Giants.</p>

	<p>Jimmy will miss Carlos&#8217; cappuccinos, but it <span class="caps">MAKES</span> <span class="caps">JIMMY</span> <span class="caps">HAPPY</span> <span class="caps">BOSS</span> when he sees people happy and in the <a href="being-boss-is-a-fucking-process.html">third step of the process</a>.</p>

	<p>Boss out!</p>

	<p id="fn8243642948a09527ea64e" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup> <a href="files/bnice.mp3" title="MP3 sound file - 90KB.">Calm it cool</a> <em>(MP3 sound file, 90KB)</em> and don&#8217;t get a heart-attack if you&#8217;re a professional. Yes, lots of them are needed and are <span class="caps">NICE</span>. Even Jimmy is one, part-time. </p>

	<p>Hear! hear! That&#8217;s right, Being your own boss means taking control of your own life. Follow your bliss. Do what you are passionate about. No just go to work for money to pay bills and be chained to a consumerist system. Life is short to be tether to a boring corporate job.</p>
