# Out-of-warranty Leica M8 shutter broke during travels in Thailand. Sent it to Leica, where it was quickly repaired, cleaned, adjusted and sent back to me with a new one-year warranty for a reasonable price. A new protective film for the LCD and a lens cleaning cloth were also in the package. Excellent.
# Under-warranty Ricoh GRD III panel peeled off and two buttons stopped working during travels in Thailand and Vietnam. The camera continued to work with less functionality and no way to quickly set snap focus. Sent it to Ricoh where it was completely repaired and refurbished and sent back to me for free. A new protective film for the LCD was already applied to the camera. Excellent.
