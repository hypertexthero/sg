Mr. Muntazer al-Zaidi,

It is unfortunate that you end "your Guardian article":http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/sep/17/why-i-threw-shoe-bush with having thrown the shoe in the name of 'patriotism'. Why not in the name of "humanism":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism, instead?

Patriotism is what aided the invasion and occupation of Iraq to begin with, and one of the principal causes of war along with nationalism and organized religion (mechanical thought).

What if all the soldiers had said 'no' when ordered to go kill innocent people in another land?
