p(preamble). "LightZone (Lightcrafts website.)":http://www.lightcrafts.com has a lovely, "intuitive feel (The Thing about Intuition, by Fabio Riccardi.)":http://fricc.blogspot.com/2006/03/thing-about-intuition.html. It is the most exciting photographic development software I've used in a long time, and an important part of my "workflow (SimonGriffee.com)":http://simongriffee.com/about/. 


Yesterday I had the pleasure of meeting the LightZone team in Palo Alto. I like the faces behind the software, and encourage you to visit them at the "Macworld Expo (Booth 3306.)":http://www.macworldexpo.com if you're in San Francisco next week. Booth 3306.

<em>PS. I'm still in the process of deciding what to post where in "DLog (Hypertexthero Design Log.)":http://hypertexthero.com/dlog/ and this journal. In the meantime, there might be some cross-posts, such as "this one (DLog - LightZone.)":http://hypertexthero.com/dlog/lightzone. </em>
