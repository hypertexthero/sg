<!-- The camera I use to take this picture was returned to me today. -->
[John Ryan Brubaker]() [said 'Hey!'](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152746056061912&set=a.10150244342661912.343102.561456911&type=1&theater&notif_t=like_tagged) and now I'm in some type of _B&W Photography Challenge_ where one one black and white picture is to be posted a day, for five days, and another photographer is to be said 'Hey!' to, each day, so that they may play, if yay. 

Okay. 

This is my first picture, and today I say 'Hey!' to [Mino Togna](http://www.minotogna.com/ "Currently traveling in 'Nam, so may not reply.").
