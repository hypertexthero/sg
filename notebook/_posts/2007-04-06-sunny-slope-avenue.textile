Getting my first Leica was an "unlucky experience (Marks on brand new M8 normal?)":http://www.leica-camera-user.com/digital-forum/19165-marks-brand-new-m8-lensmount-normal.html. I fell in love with the feel of the camera however, and now have a new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLeica-10-3MP-Digital-Rangefinder-Viewfinder%2Fdp%2FB000J6FTVK%2F&amp;tag=hypertexthero-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" title="If you buy an M8 from Amazon after following this link you will help me, thank you!">M8</a> along with a Leitz 50mm lens from the late 50sâ€“60s in great condition acquired from "International Camera":http://www.icamera.com/index.html in downtown Oakland. I went cycling around town to test the lens, and am happy to publish my first picture made with a rangefinder!
