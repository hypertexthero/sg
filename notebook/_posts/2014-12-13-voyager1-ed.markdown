Came across [Voyager 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1) while [flying](http://hypertexthero.com/logbook/2014/09/experience-flying-spaceship/ "The Experience of Flying in a Spaceship.") around the [Cosmos](http://hypertexthero.com/logbook/2014/03/cosmos/ "Cosmos. Carl Sagan is holding a photo of the plaque attached to Voyager.") in [Elite: Dangerous](http://www.elitedangerous.com/ "Elite: Dangerous website.")! It is [where it should be in the year 3300](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/2owop5/this_is_the_secret_that_was_in_the_changelog/cmr8tuf "Reddit commenters do the math.").

Elite is [the most inspiring artwork I experienced in 2014](http://hypertexthero.com/logbook/2014/07/elite-dangerous-education/ "Elite: Dangerous Education.").
