bq. "In general I have always felt that we look at pictures too quickly, almost without pausing. We pick up a picture give it a glance and pass on to the next one: just a simple visual impression without taking the time to absorb the detail contained in the picture; without placing value on the esthetic or trying to understand the photographerâ€™s intention."
