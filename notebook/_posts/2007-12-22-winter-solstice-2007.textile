Today is the "day of the Winter Solstice":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_solstice in the "Northern Hemisphere":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_hemisphere. According to Wikipedia, the solstice will happen at precisely 06:08 "Zulu Time":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zulu_time. The last sentence was just an excuse to use the word ZU-LU.
