p(preamble). Banco Banespa's building towers over the metropolis. The financial institutions usually get the top floors, and in Brazil it's no different. A country of extreme contrasts, the very rich, and the very poor. In Rio de Janeiro, it is the very poor who have the best views in the city, topographically speaking.
