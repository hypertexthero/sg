bq.. The light in this place is really bad
Like being in the bottom of a stream
Any minute now I'm expecting to wake up from a dream

Miss so much
The softest touch
Like the grave of some child 
Child who neither wept nor smiled
I'm hiding my faith in the rain
I've been dreamin' of you
That's all I do
And it's driving me insane

Somewhere dawn is breaking
Light is streaking across the floor
Church bells are ringing
I wonder who they're ringing for
Travel under any star
You'll see me wherever you are

The shadowy past is so vague and so vast
I'm sleeping in the balance of pain
I've been dreamin' of you
That's all I do
But it's driving me insane

Maybe they'll get me
Maybe they won't
But whatever it'is it won't be tonight
I wish your hand was in mine right now
We could go where the moon is white

For years they had me locked in a cage
Then they threw me onto the stage
Somethings just last longer then you thought they would
And they never ever explain
I'm dreamin' of you
That's all I do
And it's driving me insane

Well I eat when I'm hungry
Drink when I'm dry
Live my life on the square
Even if the flesh falls off my face
It won't matter as long as you're there

Feel like a ghost in love
Underneath the heavens above
Feel further away yhen I ever did before
Feel further than I can take
Dreamin' of you
That's all I do
But it's driving me insane

Everything in the way is so shiny today
In queer and unusual form
Spirals of golden haze here and there in a blaze
Like beams of light in a star

Maybe you're here or maybe you weren't
Maybe you touched somebody and got burned
The silent sun has got me on the run
Burning a hole in my brain
I'm dreamin' of you
That's all I do
But it's driving me 
Insane
