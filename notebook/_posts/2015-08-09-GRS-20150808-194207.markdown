Bob Dylanâ€™s [Highway 61 Revisited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_61_Revisited), released 50 years ago, was performed in its entirety by the [Watkins Family Hour house band](http://watkinsfamilyhour.com/) and guests.

My favorite performances were [Fiona](http://www.fiona-apple.com/)'s [A Mistake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pokyLl-633o) and [Shawn Colvin](http://shawncolvin.com/)'s cover of [Ballad of a Thin Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDC0b7rfK5U).
