Off the coast of Japan, flying low, type of airplane or jetpack, first flying through abandoned, destroyed giant docks with ships, broken metal. Then out to the edge of the land, waves, huge troughs and swells, undulating, high, almost reaching, up, up, fingers reaching, less energy in the flying machine, barely make it above over and onto a cliff, mom is up there, sometimes the waves come over the top, i tell her to hold on to the railing, but she lies forward as if to let the water take her.
