bq.. I have subscribed this newsgroup for a month. I thought you people are discussing all kind of strategy games. Since i am also crazy about turn-based all real-time strategy games, I had great expectation on this group. But you all f_cking people have only big mouse. Many people follow the someone's notes (totally not related to strategy games), and those f_cking messages gave me f_cking headache.  I know you all have freedom to speak or write, but you people are doing too much. Since old man says "NOBody scares shit to avoid, but they avoid because its f_cking dirty. I will stop subscribing this fucking newsgroup. If you have any other words, fuck you.

Thank you!
