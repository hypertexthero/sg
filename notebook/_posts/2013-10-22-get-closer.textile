For the 100 days between October 22nd -- Robert Capaâ€™s (Friedmann Endre) 100th birthday -- and the opening of "Capa in Color":http://www.icp.org/museum/exhibitions/capa-color at the International Center of Photography in January, Magnum Photos and the ICP are asking photographers everywhere to "GET CLOSER":http://getcloser.magnumphotos.com/.

Okay. I will do my best to respond every day for the "next 100 days (#GetCloser100)":http://simongriffee.com/search/?q=%23GetCloser100. Day 1 is "this one":http://simongriffee.com/notebook/GRS-20120401-124309.
