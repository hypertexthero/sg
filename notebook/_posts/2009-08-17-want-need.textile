bq.. most people WANT…some NEED…..

i always ask a photographer what they need to do rather than what they want to do….if they have no answer for this, then i must help them to dig deep for there is usually something buried inside which can be brought out with their work…this is no easy process for it involves uncovering all of the layers of getting through life sediment which holds many back..if the photographer is able to do this and get down down to the rich soil where creativity grows, then they will find what you already know…
