I don't often like talking about equipment, but here's something for people who ask me about cameras.

Though I use other cameras (currently Fuji X100S and Ricoh GRD), I like [rangefinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangefinder_camera "Wikipedia: Rangefinder camera.") cameras. The [Leica M](http://en.leica-camera.com/Photography/Leica-M/About-the-M-System "Avoid looking at the prices.") is — unfortunately — the only digital rangefinder camera that is made at this point in time.[^1]

The great advantage of a rangefinder is this: With some practice and experience you can _reliably focus the camera without putting it to your eye or pointing it at the subject_. You can do this because the lens rotation stops at both far and close focus points and you can judge the focus distance by _feeling_ the relative position of the finger tab on the lens, or, if you're less experienced, by looking at the distance markings on the lens.

The other advantage of the Leica is the simplicity of the manual controls necessary for photography: Aperture, shutter speed, focus, shutter release. They are right there as _mechanical, tactile_ controls. I don't like how Leicas are becoming increasingly complex with the addition of video and so on to the M model. Not that I mind new designs, but I think they should also make a more affordable model focussed on simplicity above all, something like [this](http://hypertexthero.com/logbook/2013/09/design-good-camera/ "Design Specifications for a Good Camera.").

So I recommend a Leica M9 rangefinder, but I do this with a heart weighed down by the knowledge of the price of the thing.[^2]

Leica or not, the best thing to do is choose _one camera_ and use it together with _one lens of one focal length_ [for an extended period of time](http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2009/05/a-leica-year.html "The Leica as Teacher.") — the camera and lens should _feel good_ in _your_ hands. You will then know your tool and have a point of reference. Tools _do_ matter, but not nearly as much as where you point them and where you stand. You need to know yourself, what's in your heart, and then you need to [make choices about what to show to the world](http://simongriffee.com/notebook/editing "Editing. Choosing is at least as important as shooting.").

[^1]: Though you may be able to find a used [Epson RD-1](http://www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/cameras/epson-rd1.shtml "Incredible that Epson, of all companies, made the first digital rangefinder."), they are no longer made, unless I'm mistaken. Someone in Japan please let me know if so! It was a good camera, with handling advantages over the Leica: It had a manual shutter winder, which I am hoping Leica will bring back to the digital M.
[^2]: You can get a [used film Leica M3](http://simongriffee.com/notebook/corso-roma-gallipoli-leica-m3-trix400 "One of, if not the mechanical instrument with the loveliest tactile feel I have ever used.") and be very happy, but the time and cost of film plus development may put you off, though many love the slower analogue process.
