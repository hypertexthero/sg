bq. "The unchecked proliferation of the picture—based on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara_(photo)">photograph by Alberto Korda</a> in 1960—is partly due to a political choice by Korda and others not to demand payment for non-commercial use of the image."

Jim Fitzpatrick, graphic artist who produced the drawing from Korda's photo:

bq. "The way they killed him, there was to be no memorial, no place of pilgrimage, nothing. I was determined that the image should receive the broadest possible circulation. His image will never die, his name will never die."
