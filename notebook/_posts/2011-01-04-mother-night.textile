bq. We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.

bq. Say what you will about the sweet miracle of unquestioning faith, I consider a capacity for it terrifying and absolutely vile.

bq. "You hate America, don't you?" she said.
"That would be as silly as loving it," I said. "It's impossible for me to get emotional about it, because real estate doesn't interest me. It's no doubt a great flaw in my personality, but I can't think in terms of boundaries. Those imaginary lines are as unreal to me as elves and pixies. I can't believe that they mark the end or the beginning of anything of real concern to the human soul. Virtues and vices, pleasures and pains cross boundaries at will."

bq. Make love when you can. It's good for you.

â€” Kurt Vonnegut, _Mother Night_
