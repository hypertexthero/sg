I had a pleasant conversation with painter, actor and all-around artist "Emidio Antoci":http://www.omero.it/rivista.php?itemid=1258&catid=43 in bar San Calisto in Trastevere. 

He gave me a drawing of myself and "Amber":http://descriptedlines.com which he made on the spot despite his failing eyesight. I must make an enlargement of it and bring it back to him.
