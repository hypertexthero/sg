Captured in a hotel room. I hadn't watched T.V. for a long time and the amount of garbage on still surprised me. I remember reading that people in the United States spend an average of thirty percent of their lives "watching television (Google search: average time us person spends watching commercials on television.)":http://www.google.com/search?=en&q=average+time+us+person+spends+watching+commercials+on+television. Maybe it is not that much, but any time watching commercials is too much wasted time. I am glad I "moved away from advertising (Brand Bonfire.)":http://hypertexthero.com/dlog/brand-bonfire.
