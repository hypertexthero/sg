> …'cause this way you can also see that everyone isn't gonna bite you. I mean if you have one bad incident that might…then you'll say _"that fucking [Bruce Gilden](http://brucegilden.com "See Bruce's website."), you know…he got my jaw broken"_ or something…but… Look, I've been photographing all these years and my face is in one piece.
