After spending the first night in Bright Angel campground, and most of next day in the creek, the ascent back to the other world began.

The hike on Bright Angel trail was in two stages. The first in late afternoon, to Indian Gardens campground, arriving in the dark and going straight to sleep. The second in early morning, up to the top of the South Rim.

This is a view of the Zoroaster Temple rock from the south-west, shortly after departing Bright Angel campground.
