The Tribunale Ordinario di Roma has annulled the confiscation order and hopefully I'm [getting my camera back](/notebook/police-aggression-coercion-photographing-colosseum-rome#u11 "Police Aggression and Coercion When Photographing by the Colosseum in Rome.") in a few days. 

It&rsquo;s not over yet and the charges against me still need to be dismissed, but this is an important victory towards that. Many thanks to everyone who has helped me, especially Odila, Amber and my lawyer [Andrea Monti](http://www.andreamonti.com/).
