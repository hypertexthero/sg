This is Day 2 of 5 of [black and white photo fest](/notebook/GRS-20140116-195618), where, after being named by [John Ryan Brubaker](http://jrbrubaker.com/), I'm to post one black and white photo per day and name a photographer I would like to see do the same. Today I name [Gaspar Hijo de Carlos](http://ercjspr.tumblr.com/).
