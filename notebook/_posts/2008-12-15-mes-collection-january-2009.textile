h1(#StoryPhotoTitle). Approaching Bear's Lodge Butte, Wyoming, US, June 2005

The first _Mês Collection Print_ is one of my favorite photographs from my road trip from New York City to San Francisco in the summer of 2005 (other photographs from this time will soon appear in the "Stories":/stories/ section). The road and the changing sites and events around it such as "Devil's Tower":/notebook/bears-lodge-butte moved and changed _me_. 

I embarked on that road trip to eliminate my office-insect routine. I ended up also eliminating countless insects with the 1990 red Saab 900, and their entrails had to be wiped off the windshield often. To me, the dirty windscreen and the road and natural scene outside tells a story about the land I traveled and is a symbol of the need to step out the door and _go_.

This "carbon ink print":/prints#printqualities is printed onto _Hahnemühle Photo Rag 308g/m<sup>2</sup>_ and is available in a limited edition of 100 A5-size prints costing €60 and 40 A4-size prints costing €90 from now until the end of January 2009, after which the prices will increase to €80 and €110, respectively. Prints are currently only available unmatted.
