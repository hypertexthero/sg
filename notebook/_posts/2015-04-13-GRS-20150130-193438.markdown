The lion guarding the north side of the library [is called Fortitude](http://www.nypl.org/help/about-nypl/library-lions "His friend, Patience, guards the south.").

Visiting the library? Don't miss [Public Eye: 175 Years of Sharing Photography](http://www.nypl.org/events/exhibitions/public-eye), which has so much iconic work on display that I feel nervous being there and [often just hide](/notebook/GRS-20150320-153314 "Iâ€™m there, somewhere :)"), and [William Meyers](http://www.williammeyersphotography.com/)' whimsical, lovely photographs from the [Outer Boroughs](http://www.nypl.org/events/exhibitions/william-meyers-outer-boroughs).
