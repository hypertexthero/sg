A year before "seeing Buddy Guy in San Francisco":/photographs/buddy-guy I saw his brother Phil play in Chicago. The venue was Buddy's own "Legends (Buddy Guy's Legends Blues Club.)":http://www.buddyguys.com/. Phil Guy is a terrific guitarist and singer, coalescing many different blues styles into his own repertoire. I recommend his album _Funky Booty_, which I bought directly from him that night.
