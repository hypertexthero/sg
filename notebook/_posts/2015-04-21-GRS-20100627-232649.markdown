My mother Odila — a very strong woman. Much, much stronger than I or anyone else I know! Mom gave me my first 'serious' [camera][1] in 1997, a manual Canon single lens reflex with which I [learned the technical side of photography][2]. 

I've been learning the more difficult side — where to stand, where to point the camera and what's in my heart — ever since! Cameras have taught me more about people, the world around me and myself than most anything, though it is best when combined with books, music and whatever you [love][3].

Thank you, mom!
