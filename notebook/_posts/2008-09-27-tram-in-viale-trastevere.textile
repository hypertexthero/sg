Pictures of surfaces with reflections remind me of human thought…Flowing all over the place, with glimpses of ideas, shapes of memories, constant movement… These pictures remind me of J. Krishnamurti's writing about "thought, knowledge and the need for your mind to be still (Freedom From The Known - Jiddy Krishnamurti.)":http://www.freeweb.hu/tchl/freedom_from_the_known/freedom_from_the_known.html, free from anxiety.
