A "new story available in the usual gallery format":/stories/the-island.html, and also as a "5-minute slideshow with music by Pink Floyd (Marooned, from The Division Bell, by David Gilmour and Richard Wright.)":/theisland/ (recommended).

The "slideshow":/theisland/ is set in a deliberately slow pace. If you don't have time, I recommend the "gallery":/stories/the-island.html instead
