Twenty-five second exposure at around eight p.m. in Jumbo Rock campground at Joshua Tree national park. "Mirror lock-up (Understanding Mirror Lock-Up - Luminous-landscape.com)":http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/understanding-series/mirror-lock.shtml was used. I believe the bright constellation on the top-right is Orion.
