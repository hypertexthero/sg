Just finished reading [Zona](http://geoffdyer.com/2012/02/06/zona/) by my favorite writer-who-is-not-dead [Geoff Dyer](http://simongriffee.com/notebook/GRS-20150326-200133) after [my trusted librarian](http://amberpaulen.com/ "And lovely.") recommended it to me.

First time I watched Andrei Tarkovsky's [Stalker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalker_%281979_film%29), the film Zona is about, I was too stoned to remember what I thought about it the following day, but I do remember what I felt, and recommed you watch Andrei's film  and read Geoff's book, too. 

The photograph above also reminds me of the Zone, which I seem to return to at regular intervals in my life, the last time being in 2010 while reading Arkady and Boris Strugatsky's novel [Roadside Picnic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadside_Picnic) which Tarkovsky's film is loosely based on, and prior to that while exploring the [Chernobyl Exclusion Zone](http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2010/05/ghosts-of-future-borrowing-architecture.html) in the [Stalker computer game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.T.A.L.K.E.R.:_Shadow_of_Chernobyl) in 2007.
