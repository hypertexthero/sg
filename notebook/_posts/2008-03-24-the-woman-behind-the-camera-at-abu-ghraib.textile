title: The woman behind the camera at Abu Ghraib
excerpt: "bq. \"Of course, the dominant symbol of Western civilization is the figure of a nearly naked man, tortured to death\xE2\x80\x94or, more simply, the torture implement itself, the cross. But our pictures of the savage death of Jesus are the product of religious imagination and idealization. In reality, he must have been ghastly to behold. Had there been cameras at Calvary, would twenty centuries of believers have been moved to hang photographs of the scene on their altarpieces and in their homes?\"\r\n\
