In January 2007 I [attended](/notebook/joshua-tree-gettogether) a photography workshop with [Per Volquartz](http://www.volquartz.com/pervolquartz/phot.html) and a mix of photographers in Joshua Tree National Park in California. Per was a master photographer and printer and a kind, joyful person. 

When I searched for his website recently I was saddened to learn he passed away in 2011, so I went back to [these pictures](/stories/joshua-tree) I took during those days and nights on the high desert. 

These are for [Per](http://www.volquartz.com/pervolquartz/music.html "Per on Music and creativity.").
