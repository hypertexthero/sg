After supervising over BIG DATA sets with [Gaspar Hijo de Carlos](http://eternalcitystyle.tumblr.com/) we have concluded [B&W photo festa](/notebook/GRS-20140116-195618) needs to be extended to name further photographic stakeholders we'd like to see post black and white photograph-thing a day for cinco d√≠as and, on each dia the 'post' button is declicked, name further stakeholders they would like see perform the same action and pray their wish comes true.

GHdC stresses that rather than a straight jacket, this is an _enabler_.
