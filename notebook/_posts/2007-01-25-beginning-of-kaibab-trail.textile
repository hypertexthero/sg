p(preamble). Early morning, and a breath-taking six hour hike ahead, down to Bright Angel campground across the Colorado river in the bottom of the Canyon. 

Every shade of red and green and yellow, bright, dark, all in between; a landscape filled with a life all its own. The 'fog' was smoke from a natural fire on the North rim.
