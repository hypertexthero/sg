Daido Moriyama in ‘[In Pictures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foWAs3V_lkg)’:

> Japanese people often talk of home as a place where you are born, grow up and everyone is there. But I don't have such a home. I've been moving a lot since I was a child. I am creating my own home by conneting pieces of images from my imagination and things I saw as a child. That's how I feel about my work.
