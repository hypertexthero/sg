bq. "In 2003, I carried a plastic Holga camera with me for about 8 months during my travels. What began as a simple diversion became a sort of therapy and exercise in seeing. Because of the limitations of the camera, I was unable to precisely control composition and exposure. The camera leaked light causing color shifts and quite unexpected results. Photography with this camera became more about the act of making a picture rather then the picture itself, and I experimented with making only one picture of any given situation. Instinct and reflex were the only guiding principles in making the pictures. The result was pictures that were not "about" anything at all but were still, in their way, "true". Thus the title, Nonfiction."
