I saw you toss the kites on high  
And blow the birds about the sky;  
And all around I heard you pass,  
Like ladies' skirts across the grass —  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O wind, a-blowing all day long,  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O wind, that sings so loud a song!

I saw the different things you did,  
But always you yourself you hid.  
I felt you push, I heard you call,  
I could not see yourself at all —   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O wind, a-blowing all day long,  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O wind, that sings so loud a song! 

O you that are so strong and cold,  
O blower, are you young or old?  
Are you a beast of field and tree,  
Or just a stronger child than me?    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O wind, a-blowing all day long,   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O wind, that sings so loud a song!
