bq. "Our political and military leaders were telling us one thing, and photographers were telling us another. I believed the photographers, and so did millions of other Americans."

…

bq. "One of the things I had to learn as a journalist was what to do with my anger. I had to use it, channel its energy, turn it into something that would clarify my vision instead of clouding it."

…

bq. "It was a story that wasn't trying to sell anything. Journalism had provided a channel for people's natural sense of generosity, and the readers responded."

…

bq. "I've been photographing in the Islamic world since 1981. Not only in the Middle East but also in Africa, Asia and Europe. At the time I was photographing in these different places I thought I was covering separate stories but on nine-eleven history crystallized, and I understood I'd actually been covering a single story for more than twenty years, and the attack on New York was its latest manifestation."
