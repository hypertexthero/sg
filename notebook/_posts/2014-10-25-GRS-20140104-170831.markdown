After alternating between clicking various buttons and hitting many different keys on my keyboard I've managed to post this photograph which would be page 3 of 5 in a [black and white photographic menu](/notebook/GRS-20140116-195618). 

I'm to serve one _souffl√©-with-cream_ per day and point out a photographer I would like to see cook the same. Today I shout into [Richard Jensen's](http://richardjensenphoto.com/ "Childhood friend and photographer.") kitchen demanding five dishes on the double, with double sauce on top.

This is all [John Ryan Brubaker's](http://jrbrubaker.com/) fault.
