Can you provide a firmware update for the Leica M8 with the following feature, please? It really would make me very happy.

bq. "Because we've all missed a shot or two by flipping the shooting mode selector switch to self-timer by accident, Leica has come to the rescue with a 0 sec self-timer menu setting. In other words, it disables the self-timer and makes the shutter release behave like it would in single shot mode. Just another example of working to address user concerns."

Thanks!
