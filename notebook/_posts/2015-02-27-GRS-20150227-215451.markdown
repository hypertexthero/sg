I heard Leonard Nimoy had died today while walking down a street. I stopped, and suddenly overcome with grief, cried. 

Goodbye, Spock. I will miss you.

Leonard's [final tweet](https://twitter.com/TheRealNimoy/status/569762773204217857):

> A life is like a garden. Perfect moments can be had, but not preserved, except in memory. <abbr title="Live long and propser.">LLAP</abbr>
