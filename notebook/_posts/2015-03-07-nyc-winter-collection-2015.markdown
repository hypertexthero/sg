_Your Perfect Outfit & Accessories for Winter Photography in New York City._

- **Soft Cloth** To dry camera viewfinder & lens.
- **Wool Scarf** Long enough to wrap around neck twice & wide enough to cover the whole thing.
- **Pocket Computer** Also phone, map & messenger.
- **Passport** Hateful, though necessary to get around in our contemporary world of fashion.
- **Notebook** Thoughts, places, dates, names & numbers.
- **Pen** To write the above.
- **Wallet** To carry SD & library card & other bits.
- **SD Memory Card** In wallet. 2nd one in camera.
- **Hat** Two, one made of wool.
- **Skiing Jacket** Wind & waterproof, with removable down lining & hood.
- **T-Shirt** Wear more than one if its cold. Make sure they are long & remain easily tucked into trousers.
- **Sweater** Wear heavier ones if very cold or you plan to stay in one spot for a long time.
- **Gloves** With inner lining. If the snow is too wet & you are outside too long you can dry them quickly in the warm vents by the revolving doors at fashionable spots such as Time Warner Center.
- **Trousers** Not too tight. With inner lining.  
- **Belt** Tighten when on your feet. Loosen when sitting down to rest, eat, drink and mingle.
- **Snow Boots** Waterproof, with inner lining. Rated to -40˚C though I don’t plan to test that.
- **Socks** Long ones. Fold over top of boots to avoid rashes.
- **Water Bottle** Carried in inner jacket pocket or in a backpack when available. Refill at potable water faucets & fountains. Avoid unneeded plastic.
- **Nuts & Berries** For when hungry & far away or taking pictures of squirrels or celebrities.
- **Rangefinder Camera & 35mm Lens** Leather case to help not freeze your hands, nose or cheeks off.
- **Spare Batteries & Keys on Carabiner** For hipster <abbr title="Cred is Hipster Delta for Credibility, which means 'for people to believe what they are seeing in front of them is actually real.'">cred</abbr> for when going to hip places. If shooting a long time, far away, consider extra batteries, cards & camera in a small backpack.
