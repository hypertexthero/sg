Can't find a website (does this need to be fixed? Let me "know":http://hypertexthero.com/contact), but I see thousands of cyclists streaming through Via Labicana, stopping motorized traffic, right now. Makes me miss "SF":http://simongriffee.com/notebook/critical-mass-on-halloween! Will be joining with my bike in four weeks!
