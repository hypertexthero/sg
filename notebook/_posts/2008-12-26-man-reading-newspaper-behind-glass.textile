While I was redesigning SimonGriffee.com David & crew were busy redesigning David Alan Harvey's online forum which is now "Burn Magazine":http://www.burnmagazine.org/: an evolving journal for emerging photographers, curated by Magnum photographer "David Alan Harvey":http://davidalanharvey.com. Go and "sit by the fire there":http://www.burnmagazine.org/road-trips/2008/12/welcome-to-burnand-dialogue/ and listen from time to timeâ€¦ I've learned much doing so!
