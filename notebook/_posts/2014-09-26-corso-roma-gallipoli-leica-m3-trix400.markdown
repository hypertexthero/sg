A [retrospective exhibition of a pretty good photographer](http://www.arapacis.it/mostre_ed_eventi/mostre/henri_cartier_bresson "Henri Cartier-Bresson. From France, I think.") begins today at Rome&rsquo;s Ara Pacis museum. 

To celebrate this and photography I will do some shooting with a 1950&rsquo;s Leica M3 with 50mm collapsible Æ’/2 Summicron loaded with Tri-X 400 film and post anything decent here, starting with the above from Salento.
