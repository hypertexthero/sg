p(preamble). After the house-warming party the night before it was decided we would take Highway 1 back to Oakland and see the rough beauty where the Pacific meets the Sonoma coast. This is the beach where I gazed at the sun setting into the Great Ocean, not into clouds or into fog, for the first time. Photography is a constant way to _see things for the first time_; at the moment of capture, at a later time, or both.
