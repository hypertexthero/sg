bq. one of the things i find when faced with a workshop of say ten students is how few of them have dreams….yes, they have all come to me with serious portfolios and perhaps outsized ambition..but ambition has nothing to do with dreams…many have ambition but no dreams..this always surprises me but after some time now i realize this is actually the norm…i always had assumed everyone had dreams…i think dreams get buried quickly in most people just by growing up in society where dreams are quickly sublimated by authority…my job as a mentor is to try to get photographers to dig dig dig and try to remember their dreams…i must find this key or help them to find it…i am not sure about strength or fortitude or anything else…i imagine those traits as helpful, but not the main nut… but i am sure one must start with a dream, live with a dream, and end with a dream…
