Seeing "Buddy Guy (BuddyGuy.net)":http://buddyguy.net/ play at the "Fillmore (Wikipedia - The Fillmore.)":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fillmore was a dream come true. Got there early, sneaked in my camera hidden in the bottom pocket of my bag and went to the front, directly below the stage.

Focusing with the 300D in the dark is a challengeâ€”you can't trust the auto-focus, you can't see clearly through the small viewfinder, even with the f/1.4 50mm lens. No matter, the soft focus here works well as an expression that night's feeling.

Buddy Guy plays the way life should be lived: With passion, with love and laughter. He inspired everyone from Jimi Hendrix to Stevie Ray Vaughan, and at 70, continues on the road, a bright blue ray of light in the world. Listening to Buddy Guy is an incredible experience.
