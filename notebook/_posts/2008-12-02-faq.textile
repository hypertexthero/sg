h1. Prints <acronym title="Frequently asked questions">FAQ</acronym>

h2. Why are your prices so high?

To "develop (Fine Art Black and White Digital Printing. An Overview of The Current State Of The Art. By Clayton Jones.)":http://www.cjcom.net/articles/digiprn1.htm, print, pack and send a fine photographic print takes time. Rather than become a robot I want to sell only enough prints to make a comfortable living. I like the idea of there only being a small number of my prints in existence.

h2. Why are your prices so low?

I am young, but rest assured they will go up regularly!
