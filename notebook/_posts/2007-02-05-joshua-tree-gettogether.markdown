*Update April 2015:* I've gone back to the photos and put together [this edit](/stories/joshua-tree).

Here are some photos from the lovely weekend spent at Joshua Tree national park with [Per Volquartz](http://www.volquartz.com/pervolquartz/phot.html) and several other photographers. More about my experience in the desert is forthcoming.
