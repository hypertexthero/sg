This is my final picture response to "#GetCloser100":http://getcloser.magnumphotos.com/.  

It's too bad the campaign "ran into problems (Photos repeated or missing altogether.)":http://simongriffee.com/notebook/GRS-20131223-114915#textframe, maybe because the Get Closer 100 website was designed as a needlessly complex "JavaScript-based (Sigh, JavaScript.)":http://sighjavascript.tumblr.com/about one-page <a href="http://softwaresimply.blogspot.it/2014/01/emberjs-is-driving-me-crazy.html" title="Don't create complex solutions for problems that have already been solved with simple ones.">application</a>? I think simple HTML pages for each day such as _http://getcloser.magnumphotos.com/day001.html_, which would have been easy to link to, would have been "better (Web standards are still important.)":http://www.thenoodleincident.com/tutorials/box_lesson/why.html. Also, the campaign doesn't seem complete without a response from Henri Cartier-Bresson.

Ultimately Get Closer 100 was a good exercise in looking at and thinking about photographs, photography and human beings and I thank "Magnum Photos (The greatest photo agency has, unfortunately, one of the worst websites.)":http://magnumphotos.com/ and the "International Center of Photography (Robert Capa at 100.)":http://www.icp.org/robert-capa-100 <sup id="footref1"><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> for organizing it and allowing responses from the public. Photography is, after all, one of the great democratic forms of art.
