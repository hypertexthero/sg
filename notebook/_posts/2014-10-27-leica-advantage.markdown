The [Leica M](http://en.leica-camera.com/Photography/Leica-M/About-the-M-System "Avoid looking at the prices.") is — unfortunately — the only digital rangefinder camera that is made at this point in time.[^1]

The great advantage of a rangefinder is this: With some practice and experience you can _reliably focus the camera without putting it to your eye or pointing it at the subject_. You can do this because the lens rotation stops at both far and close focus points and you can judge the focus distance by _feeling_ the relative position of the finger tab on the lens, or, if you're less experienced, by looking at the distance markings on the lens.

The other advantage of the Leica is the simplicity of the manual controls necessary for photography: Aperture, shutter speed, focus, shutter release. They are right there as _mechanical, tactile_ controls. I don't like how Leicas are becoming increasingly complex with the addition of video and so on to the M model. Not that I mind new designs, but I think they should also make a more affordable model focussed on simplicity above all, something like [this](http://hypertexthero.com/logbook/2013/09/design-good-camera/ "Design Specifications for a Good Camera.").

When I am asked what camera is best to [learn photography](http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2009/05/a-leica-year.html "The Leica as Teacher.") with I still do recommend a Leica, but I do it with a heart weighed down by the knowledge of the price of the thing.[^2]

[^1]: Though you may be able to find a used [Epson RD-1](http://www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/cameras/epson-rd1.shtml "Incredible that Epson, of all companies, made the first digital rangefinder."), they are no longer made, unless I'm mistaken. Someone in Japan please let me know if so! It was a good camera, with handling advantages over the Leica: It had a manual shutter winder, which I am hoping Leica will bring back to the digital M.
[^2]: You can get a [used film Leica M3](http://simongriffee.com/notebook/corso-roma-gallipoli-leica-m3-trix400 "One of, if not the mechanical instrument with the loveliest tactile feel I have ever used.") and be very happy, but the time and cost of film plus development may put you off, though many continue to love the slower analogue process.
