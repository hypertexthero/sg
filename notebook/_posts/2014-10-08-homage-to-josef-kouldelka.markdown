I'm in a trip through photographs taken but never edited into a story, currently revisiting Prague in December 2012 which you can see [here](/stories/prague.html "In the Stories section.") along with a [3-minute slideshow with music](/prague/ "Pražský. Music: On the Overgrown Path #4 - 'The Holy Virgin of Frýdek (Grave)'. Composed by Leoš Janáček. Performed by Josef Páleníček. Photographs: Simon Griffee.") composed by [Leoš Janáček](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo%C5%A1_Jan%C3%A1%C4%8Dek#Piano "Heard about his work from Haruki Murakami.") and performed by [Josef Páleníček](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJ20PF1l_Q "Incredible presence.") (recommended). 

The above picture is a homage to [Josef Kouldelka](http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/24/photography "Read an interview.").
