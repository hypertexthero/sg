I'm in a trip through photographs taken but never edited into a story, currently revisiting [Prague in December 2012](/stories/prague.html "In the Stories section."). There is also a [3-minute slideshow with music](/prague/ "Pražský. Music: On the Overgrown Path #4 - 'The Holy Virgin of Frýdek (Grave)'. Composed by Leoš Janáček. Performed by Josef Páleníček. Photographs: Simon Griffee.") composed by [Leoš Janáček](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo%C5%A1_Jan%C3%A1%C4%8Dek#Piano) and performed by [Josef Páleníček](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJ20PF1l_Q) (recommended).
