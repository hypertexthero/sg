    Bm...
    Bm                          Em     F# 
    The moon is hanging in a purple sky
    Bm                            Em     F#  F#  F
    Baby's sleeping while his mother sighs
    Em  F#                 Am
    Talking about the rich folks
                                Dm
    The rich folks have the same jokes
            F#              Am
    But they park in basic places

    The priest is preaching from a shallow grave
    Counts his money, then he paints you saved
    Talking 'bout the young folks
    Young folks share the same jokes
    But they meet in older places

    CHORUS: 
        Em    F#            Am
    So don't tell me about your success
    Em         F#              Am
    Nor your recipes for my happiness
    Em        F#             Am
    Smoke in bed, I never could digest
            Em       F#                 Am
    Those illusions you claim to have going
    
    The sun is shining as it always done
    Coffin dust is the fate of everyone
    Talking about the rich folks
    The poor create the rich hoax
    And only late breast fed fools believe it

    CHORUS
