Stone river, water ain't runnin' no more
Stone river, water ain't runnin' no more

Man he done come and gone
Polluted all around
There ain't no river runnin'
No water can be found
Stone river, water ain't runnin' no more

Fish ain't swimmin' 
Ain't no fish around nowhere
Fish ain't swimmin'
Ain't nobody seem to care

They botteled up and dammed it
Choked it up and canned it
Killed the life around it
And stole it like a bandit
Stone river, Water ain't runnin' no more

What used to be a river
Now is just an empty site
Ain't no vegetation
It's just an agitation
It don't seem right

There ain't no trees growin'
No animals are showin'
What used to be a stream
Now is just a dream

Stone river, water ain't runnin' nowhere
Stone river, Water ain't runnin' nowhere

The Man he done cut it off
And moved it all around
There ain't no river runnin'
No water can't be found
Stone river, water ain't runnin' no more

They botteled up and dammed it
Choked it up and canned it
Killed the life around it
And stole it like a bandit
Stone river, water ain't runnin' no more

There ain't no trees growin'
No animals are showin'
What used to be a stream
Is now just a dream
Stone river, water ain't runnin' nowhere

Stone river, water ain't runnin' nowhere
Stone river, water ain't runnin' no more.
