In beauty may I walk.<br> 
All day long may I walk.<br> 
Through the returning seasons may I walk.<br> 
On the trail marked with pollen may I walk.<br> 
With grasshoppers about my feet may I walk.<br> 
With dew about my feet may I walk.<br> 
With beauty may I walk.<br> 
With beauty before me may I walk.<br> 
With beauty behind me may I walk.<br> 
With beauty above me may I walk.<br> 
With beauty below me may I walk.<br> 
With beauty all around me, may I walk.<br> 
In old age wandering on a trail of beauty, lively, may I walk.<br> 
In old age wandering on a trail of beauty, living again, may I walk.<br> 
It is finished in beauty.<br> 
It is finished in beauty.
