A drawing to celebrate a surreal day where things that give me energy — design, technology and photography — intertwined.

Met [Milton](http://www.miltonglaser.com/milton/), [Sue, and Dan](http://www.miltonglaser.com/the-studio) in their studio in the morning. Bemused Chelsea gallery receptionists with inquiries regarding work submissions and visited [Google](http://www.google.com/about/company/philosophy/) in the afternoon (thanks, Gino!). Photographed in Union Square then spent time with other photography aficionados at [Professor Thom's](https://www.professorthoms.com/parties.php) (thanks [Mike](http://mikeip.com/), [Theo](http://www.theozierock.com/) and [Marie](http://www.marieamonteleonephotoeditor.com/)!) in the evening.

[Feeling lucky](http://www.tnellen.com/cybereng/shorts/white.html). On to tomorrow!
