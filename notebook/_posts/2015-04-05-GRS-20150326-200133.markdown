One of my favorite contemporary writers, [Geoff Dyer](http://geoffdyer.com/), in a [Strand Books](http://www.strandbooks.com/) panel discussion with [Nikil Saval](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/15/books/review/cubed-by-nikil-saval.html) and [Jenny Davidson](http://jennydavidson.blogspot.com/) surrounding society's impact on literature through Raymond Williams' interviews in a new edition of Politics and Letters which includes an updated introduction by Dyer.

Dyer signed my copy of his book about photography, [The Ongoing Moment](http://geoffdyer.com/2011/04/06/the-ongoing-moment/) that I warmly recommend along with his book about life on an aircraft carrier, [Another Great Day at Sea: Life Aboard the USS George HW Bush](http://www.npr.org/2014/05/20/312190747/a-great-day-at-sea-for-a-brit-aboard-an-american-carrier), which includes pictures by [Chris Steele-Perkins](http://www.chrissteeleperkins.com/).
