One of my favorite contemporary writers, Geoff Dyer, in a Strand Books panel discussion with Nikil Saval and Jenny Davidson surrounding society's impact on literature through Raymond Williams' interviews in a new edition of _Politics and Letters_ which includes an updated introduction by Dyer.

Dyer signed my copy of his book about photography, _The Ongoing Moment_, which I warmly recommend, along with his book about life on an aircraft carrier with pictures by Chris Steele-Perkins, _Another Great Day at Sea: Life Aboard the USS George HW Bush_.
