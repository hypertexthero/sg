excerpt: This I write to you from high above the Atlantic, on a Lufthansa flight equipped with "internet via satellite (Connexion by Boeing.)":http://www.boeing.com/randy/archives/2005/08/blogging_the_st.html. As these days move on less is the time one spends unconnected, and yet words have been scarce here. The voyage is guilty. Mausoleum, metropolis, countryside, car, blues, greenhouses, forests. Electrical storms, insects, deserts, prairies, rivers and creeks. Mountains and abysses, gorges and buttes, mesas and lights and silence. Constellations, giant trees, fire and wind, tents and animals, ocean and fog. Three months and six thousand photographs later the words and the images are coming.
