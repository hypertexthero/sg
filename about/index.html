<h2>Simon Griffee</h2>

 <p>Like many human beings I communicate in one of our oldest languages, drawing, with one of our great <a href="http://simongriffee.com/notebook/what-camera" title="What Camera Should I Use to Learn Photography?">tools</a>, photography. Photographing helps me feel and notice the world and time I live in and <a href="http://simongriffee.com/notebook/editing" title="On Editing.">communicate</a> something of this to other people.</p>

<p>I was born in South America, have traveled and lived in a few places and don’t feel particularly attached to any particular land or label. I’m Currently surviving in New York City.</p>

We have begun to contemplate our origins: starstuff pondering the stars; organized assemblages of ten billion billion billion atoms considering the evolution of atoms; tracing the long journey by which, here at least, consciousness arose. Our loyalties are to the species and the planet. We speak for Earth. Our obligation to survive is owed not just to ourselves but also to that Cosmos, ancient and vast, from which we spring.">cosmos</a>.</p>
