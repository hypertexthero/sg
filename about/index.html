<h2>Simon Griffee</h2>

<p>Like many human beings I communicate in one of our oldest languages, drawing, with one of our great tools, photography. Photographing helps me feel and notice the world and time I live in.</p> 

<p>Though I was born in the South American continent of <a href="/earth/" title="See a drawing of Earth made with text, and click on the blue planet to read Star Maker by Olaf Stapledon.">Earth</a>, I have lived in various places and don&rsquo;t feel particularly attached to any particular land.</p> 

<p>I have traveled and worked and continue to work and travel. I am currently based in New York City.</p>
