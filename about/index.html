<h2>Simon Griffee</h2>

<p>Like many human beings I like to communicate in one of our oldest languages, drawing, with one of our great tools, photography. Photographing helps me feel and notice the world and time I live in and <a href="http://simongriffee.com/notebook/editing" title="On Editing.">convey</a> something of this to others. While my specialty is candid photography and portraiture, I point my camera at anything that touches me.</p>

<p>Born and raised in Brazil, my childhood was spent on the move there. I learned English in Tunisia and to see in Italy.</p>

<h2>Hired Work</h2>

<p>I’m currently available for hire for long or short-term assignments. When <a href="/contact/">contacting me</a> tell me the kind of coverage you’re looking for and the kind of rights you need for the photographs. I’m happy to discuss your project to best meet your needs while producing work that makes you and your own clients very happy.</p> 

<p>I like working with editors and art directors, have worked for over a decade as a <a href="http://hypertexthero.com">designer</a> and understand the requirements of photographs to meet particular layout and style needs for best print or web publishing.</p>
